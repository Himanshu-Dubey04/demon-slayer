                <h3>Tanjiro Kamado</h3>
                <p>Tanjiro Kamado (竈門 炭治郎, Kamado Tanjiro) is the oldest son of a charcoal-seller. His entire family was
                    massacred by Muzan Kibutsuji while he was selling charcoal, with only his sister Nezuko surviving,
                    having been turned into a demon. His goal is to find a cure for her and turn her back into a human,
                    and it is to this end that he decides to join the Demon Slayer Corps. He initially trained under
                    Sakonji Urokodaki, learning the "Water Breathing" (水の呼吸, Mizu no kokyū) sword-style, but later he
                    began to use his family's "Hinokami Kagura" (ヒノカミ神楽, lit. "Dance of the Fire God") technique, which
                    itself is based on the original breath style, the "Sun Breathing" (日の呼吸, Hi no kokyū) merging both
                    to create a more sustainable fighting style.</p>

                <h3>Zenitsu Agatsuma</h3>
                <p>An extremely cowardly boy who was forced to join the Demon Slayer Corps at around the same time as
                    Tanjiro to pay for his debts, Zenitsu Agatsuma (我妻 善逸, Agatsuma Zen'itsu) trained in the "Thunder
                    Breathing" (雷の呼吸, Kaminari no kokyū) style by the former Thunder Hashira, but was only able to learn
                    the first technique, and because of this he often belittles himself, despite the fact that he is
                    talented. He joins up with Tanjiro on a mission and since then, he has tagged along with him,
                    partially out of his infatuation with Nezuko, but also due to recognizing how honest and kind he is.
                    His cowardly personality initially hinders him and he is only able to fight when he is unconscious
                    or asleep, but he later learns to push his fears aside and take action when needed, to the point of
                    developing a new, exclusive thunder technique.</p>

                <h3>Inosuke Hashibira</h3>
                <p>A young boy who was raised by his mother Kotoha Hashibira for a short time until she was murdered by
                    the Upper Moon Two, Doma. After she sacrificed herself to save his life, he was raised by wild
                    boars, and then taught to read and write by an old man. Inosuke Hashibira (嘴平 伊之助, Hashibira
                    Inosuke) uses a self-taught style called "Beast Breathing" (獣の呼吸, Kedamono no kokyū), along with two
                    serrated swords in battle. When he gets new swords, he purposely makes them serrated in order to
                    match his preference and fighting style (much to the swordsmith's anger). He is brash and prone to
                    reacting violently, and while he appears dim, he has proven himself in battle time after time. He is
                    extremely muscular and rugged, which contrasts with his oddly effeminate face, which he normally
                    hides under a boar's head mask.</p>

                    eccentric but is pure-hearted and honorable as of his mother instilling him with his moral code of
                    protecting the weak. He was assigned to investigate the Mugen Train with Tanjiro and his friends and
                    helps dispatch Enmu before he is fatally wounded in his fight against Akaza of the Twelve Kizuki.
                    After using his last moments to direct Tanjiro to his father, the youth had the guard of Kyojuro's
                    broken sword installed into his new sword in respect for the Hashira.</p>

                <h3>Giyū Tomioka</h3>
                <p>The current Water Hashira; he is the first Demon Slayer that Tanjiro comes across. He initially tries
                    to kill Nezuko, but reconsiders after seeing her protect an unconscious Tanjiro as he sends them to
                    his mentor Urokodaki in the hopes that Tanjiro could succeed him and possibly cure Nezuko. He does
                    not think of himself as a true Hashira, despite mastering Water Breathing as he considered his
                    fellow apprentice Sabito, who died saving other Demon Slayers-in-training, more suited for the role.
                    He has developed an additional technique to Water Breathing, which he alone knows. He loses an arm
                    during the final battle against Muzan, but survives after the demon is destroyed.</p>
