          <h3>Art Style</h3>
          <p>
            Both the Demon Slayer film and series contain a beautiful
            combination of modern-CGI and classic Japanese animation, both of
            which provide a fresh new take on the genre. The way Ufotable (the
            anime studio) uses a traditional Japanese art style to represent the
            elemental attacks is remarkable.
